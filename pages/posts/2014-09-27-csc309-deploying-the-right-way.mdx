# CSC309: Deploying the Right Way

The first assignment in [CSC309][csc309] this semester has some rather strange methods for deploying the website:
we're required to submit an [Amazon Machine Image][ami] (AMI) with [Apache httpd][httpd] serving the website and,
while optional, we're also expected to use _VNC_ to remote into our production server and develop the site using
the included Firefox and Eclipse programs.

I've decided to adopt some [12-factor][] philosophies to make this process a bit less painful...

- Version control with [git][]
- `git push` deploys

...which allows me to develop the site on my local machine and only requires a single command to deploy.

## Set up the EC2 instance

First, make sure you have an SSH key pair configured on AWS. You can either
[create your own](./2014-01-09-public-key-authentication-on-cdf.md) and import it, or create a new one in the AWS console:

[https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs:](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs:)

Next, launch a new EC2 instance of the AMI that De Lara provides:

[https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#launchAmi=ami-cafc53a2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#launchAmi=ami-cafc53a2)

1. Choose the _t2.micro_ instance type (or _t2.small_ if you have cash to spare)
2. Click _Next_ until you get to _Step 6: Configure Security Group_
3. Create a new security group, name it something like _csc309-a1_, and allow SSH access from anywhere:

   <Image
     src={ec2SecurityGroupPng}
     alt="Security Group"
     style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
   />

4. Then go ahead and click _Review and Launch_, then _Launch_.

   Note: AWS will warn you that _Your security group, csc309-a1, is open to the world._
   Just ignore that; all this means is that port 22 (ssh) is open to the entire internet.

After a minute or so, your instance will be running and you can connect via SSH.
The AWS console will tell you to use a command like...

```bash
ssh -i your-private-key.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
```

...but you should set your default SSH key:

```bash
# SSH will automatically use the key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Spencers-MacBook$ chmod 400 your-private-key.pem
Spencers-MacBook$ mv your-private-key.pem ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This will later allow us to push to the Git remote.

## Use Git

Once our EC2 instance is set up, let's put our code under version control.

#### Create a Git repository

On your local computer, initialize Git in your project directory:

```bash
Spencers-MacBook$ cd path/to/csc309-a1/         # enter your project directory
Spencers-MacBook$ git init                      # initialize git
Spencers-MacBook$ git add .                     # add all existing files
Spencers-MacBook$ git commit -m 'First commit'  # make your first commit
```

#### Create a Git remote on the server

Once you've created your Git repo, we need to set up our EC2 instance as a Git remote.

Log into the instance and create a bare Git repository:

```bash
Spencers-MacBook$ ssh ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
ubuntu@ip-1-2-3-4:~$ git init --bare ~/csc309-a1.git
```

(Where `PUBLIC_IP` is the public IP address of your instance)

Then on your local machine, add the remote:

```bash
Spencers-MacBook$ git remote add aws ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>:csc309-a1.git
```

And make your first push:

```bash
# git will use your private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Spencers-MacBook$ git push -u aws master
```

If all went well, you should now be able to see your commit history on your EC2 instance:

```bash
ubuntu@ip-1-2-3-4:~/csc309-a1.git/$ git log --pretty=oneline
```

That `git log` command should output something like this:

```bash
141ea38b4391c22f0ac9be232c9f70439c55f515 First commit
```

## Configure a Git hook to deploy the site

Now that we can push code to the server, the final step is to create a
[Git hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) that will deploy your site
whenever you do a `git push`.

On your EC2 instance, create the _post-receive_ script:

```
ubuntu@ip-1-2-3-4:~$ nano ~/csc309-a1.git/hooks/post-receive
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
GIT_REPO=$HOME/csc309-a1.git
TMP_GIT_CLONE=$HOME/tmp/csc309-a1
PUBLIC_WWW=/var/www/html

# Clone the bare repo into a temporary repo with a working copy
git clone $GIT_REPO $TMP_GIT_CLONE

# Enter the working directory
cd $TMP_GIT_CLONE

# Copy the site to the apache directory, ignoring specific files
echo "Copying site to $PUBLIC_WWW ..."
if [ -r .rsyncexclude ]; then
  rsync --archive --delete --exclude-from=.rsyncexclude . $PUBLIC_WWW
else
  rsync --archive --delete . $PUBLIC_WWW
fi
echo "Done copying!"

# Remove the temporary repo
cd ~
rm -rf $TMP_GIT_CLONE
```

And set it to be executable:

```bash
ubuntu@ip-1-2-3-4:~$ chmod 775 ~/csc309-a1.git/hooks/post-receive
```

Optionally, you can create a file called `.rsyncexclude` in the root of your repository to exclude certain files
from being copied to the web server. Example `.rsyncexclude`:

```bash
# Files ignored by rsync when copying the site to /var/www/html/.
# All files in /var/www/html/ will be DELETED except for the files listed below.

# This file
/.rsyncexclude

# Git files
/.git
/.gitignore

# Ruby files for local testing
/.ruby-version
/Gemfile
/Gemfile.lock
/Rakefile

# README file
/README.md

# Files preserved in /var/www/html/
/phpversion.php
```

## Deploying

Finally, we can deploy our site with one simple command on our local machine:

```bash
Spencers-MacBook$ git push aws
```

To view the site, you need to open an SSH tunnel:

```bash
Spencers-MacBook$ ssh ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP> -L 8080:localhost:80
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. Alternatively, add TCP port 80 to your EC2 instance
security group inbound rules and open http://\<PUBLIC_IP\> in your browser

## Conclusion

This seems like a _lot_ of configuration for a simple static website, but I'd much rather do this over
developing my site _on the production server_. Ideally, it'd be better to use something like [Dokku][dokku],
but unfortunately that's not possible since we're required to use Apache httpd. Maybe assignment 2...

I hope this helped someone!
