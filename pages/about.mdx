# About

Hey, I'm Spencer.

I'm a web developer and University of Toronto Computer Science 2017 graduate. I've been working primarily as a **frontend** web developer since I started programming, and have built a passion for frontend **infrastructure and tooling**. I like optimizing developer workflows by understanding and using modern tools, writing plugins, and contributing back to open source.

### I've worked at:

#### [Yolk Inc](https://www.yolk.ai/) from August 2018 to present.

- Using expert-level knowledge of the web platform and related technologies ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)), I was responsible for configuring infrastructure and establishing best practices for building web applications across the company, in addition to feature development.
- Led efforts to make the development experience simple, fast, and correct. Established a monorepo architecture, designed a CLI to launch applications for development in [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), configured a parallelized continuous integration pipeline using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), among other tools which power localization, linting, testing, and building across the codebase.
- Led efforts to adopt a federated [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) on the server and client.
- Encouraged collaborative, documented architecture and design decisions using RFCs.

#### [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) from July 2017 to August 2018.

- OneDrive web team, serving both OneDrive for consumers and OneDrive for Business.
- Built the web frontend for the "Restore your OneDrive" feature, using React, TypeScript, and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/).
- Drove the adoption of optimized developer workflows, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Improved inner dev loop performance by 10x.

#### [EventMobi](https://www.eventmobi.com/) during Summer of 2014, and from May 2015 to August 2016.

- Used [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to build API-driven user interfaces.
- Drove the adoption of developer workflows with a faster inner dev loop, replacing a [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) task runner-based system with webpack.
- Co-architected an offline-enabled, hybrid web/mobile app using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), React, and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). Solved problems related to network reconnection, cache invalidation, and cross-platform offline storage.

### Open-source

I like contributing back to open source to help identify and fix issues found by myself and the developer community. Some examples:

- [[webpack] Enabled the ability to use webpack hot module replacement in web workers.](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/1580)
- [[react-native] Added the ability to automatically open the Chrome debugger on Linux and Windows.](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/3394)
- [[next.js] Debugged and documented an issue preventing Next.js from working with pnpm.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/15616#issuecomment-674557003)
  - [Fixed the issue.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/16369)
  - [Added regression tests.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/17882)
- [[jscodeshift] Collaborated to drive TypeScript support.](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/issues/180#issuecomment-443948492)
  - [Published a proof-of-concept.](https://github.com/elliottsj/jscodeshift-typescript-example)
- [[Ackee] Added support to deploy to Vercel.](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee/pull/180)
- [[rushstack] Feature request to support a workflow with isolated Docker containers.](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues/978)

### I'm also familiar with:

SQL and NoSQL databases, Python, Java (on desktop and Android), Pebble smart watch, C.
