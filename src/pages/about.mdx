# About

Hey, I'm Spencer.

I'm a web developer and University of Toronto Computer Science 2017 graduate. I've been working primarily as a **frontend** web developer since I started programming, and have built a passion for frontend **infrastructure and tooling**. I like optimizing developer workflows by understanding and using modern tools, writing plugins, and contributing back to open source.

## Contact

I am generally open to being contacted. You can reach me at [spencer@elliott.dev](mailto:spencer@elliott.dev).
